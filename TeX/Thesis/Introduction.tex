\section{Introduction}
The Jaynes Cummings model has been the subject of many different theoretical investigations in different guises \cite{Abdalla2011} \cite{Benivegna1994}. Interesting in applications is its role in quantum computing, one promising avenue being superconducting QED \cite{Bishop2010}.
