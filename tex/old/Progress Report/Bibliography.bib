abstract = {The authors calculate the asymptotic quantum state of a driven cavity mode interacting with a two-state atom when the dipole coupling constant is much larger than the atomic and cavity linewidths. They show that a novel symmetry breaking transition occurs as the strength of the driving field is increased. Although the driving field, the cavity mode, and the atom are all resonant, above the transition threshold the intracavity field shows a bimodality in phase. The bimodality results from an intensity-dependent detuning between the driving field and the transition frequencies of the composite atom-cavity-mode 'molecule.' Well above the transition threshold the driven cavity mode plus atom behaves as a driven harmonic oscillator with randomly switched detuning; the detuning (and hence the phase of the interactivity field) changes sign each time the atom makes a spontaneous transition between dressed states.},

@article{Arnold2009,
abstract = {There are dozens of books on ODEs, but none with the elegant geometric insightof Arnol'd's book. Arnol'd puts a clear emphasis on the qualitative andgeometric properties of ODEs and their solutions, rather than on theroutinepresentation of algorithms for solving special classes of equations.Of course,the reader learns how to solve equations, but with much more understanding ofthe systems, the solutions and the techniques. Vector fields and one-parametergroups of transformations come right from the startand Arnol'd uses this"language" throughout the book. This fundamental difference from the standardpresentation allows him to explain some of the real mathematics of ODEs in avery understandable way and without hidingthe substance. The text is also richwith examples and connections with mechanics. Where possible, Arnol'd proceedsby physical reasoning, using it as a convenient shorthand for much longerformal mathematical reasoning. This technique helps the student get a feel forthe subject. Following Arnol'd's guiding geometric and qualitative principles,there are 272 figures in the book, but not a single complicated formula. Also,the text is peppered with historicalremarks, which put the material incontext, showing how the ideas have developped since Newton and Leibniz. Thisbook is an excellent text for a course whose goal is a mathematical treatmentof differential equations and the related physical systems.},

abstract = {We analyze the Jaynes-Cummings model of quantum optics, in the strong-dispersive regime. In the bad-cavity limit and on time scales short compared to the atomic coherence time, the dynamics are those of a nonlinear oscillator. A steady-state nonperturbative semiclassical analysis exhibits a finite region of bistability delimited by a pair of critical points, unlike the usual dispersive bistability from a Kerr nonlinearity. This analysis explains our quantum trajectory simulations that show qualitative agreement with recent experiments from the field of circuit quantum electrodynamics.},

abstract = {The advent of lasers in the 1960s led to the development of many new fields in optical physics. This book is a systematic treatment of one of these fields-the broad area that deals with the coherence and fluctuation of light. The authors begin with a review of probability theory and random processes, and follow this with a thorough discussion of optical coherence theory within the framework of classical optics. They next treat the theory of photoelectric detection of light and photoelectric correlation. They then discuss in some detail quantum systems and effects. The book closes with two chapters devoted to laser theory and one on the quantum theory of nonlinear optics. The sound introduction to coherence theory and the quantum nature of light and the chapter-end exercises will appeal to graduate students and newcomers to the field. Researchers will find much of interest in the new results on coherence-induced spectral line shifts, nonclassical states of light, higher-order squeezing, and quantum effects of down-conversion. Written by two of the world's most highly regarded optical physicists, this book is required reading of all physicists and engineers working in optics.},

abstract = {This textbook is aimed at newcomers to nonlinear dynamics and chaos, especially students taking a first course in the subject. The presentation stresses analytical methods, concrete examples and geometric intuition. The theory is developed systematically, starting with first-order differential equations and their bifurcations, followed by phase plane analysis, limit cycles and their bifurcations, and culminating with the Lorenz equations, chaos, iterated maps, period doubling, renormalization, fractals, and strange attractors.A unique feature of the book is its emphasis on applications. These include mechanical vibrations, lasers, biological rhythms, superconducting circuits, insect outbreaks, chemical oscillators, genetic control systems, chaotic waterwheels, and even a technique for using chaos to send secret messages. In each case, the scientific background is explained at an elementary level and closely integrated with the mathematical theory.Richly illustrated, and with many exercises and worked examples, this book is ideal for an introductory course at the junior/senior or first-year graduate level. It is also ideal for the scientist who has not had formal instruction in nonlinear dynamics, but who now desires to begin informal study. The prerequisites are multivariable calculus and introductory physics.},

The classical theory of optical coherence' works almost exclusively with two-point correlations; and this theory is adequate for the description of the classical optical phenomena of interference and diffraction in general. More sophisticated experiments on intensity interferometry and photoelectric counting statistics necessitated special higher order correlations. Most of this work' was done using a classical or a semiclassical formulation of the problem. On the other hand, statistical states of a quantized (electromagnetic) field have been considered recently, ' and a quantum mechanical definition of coherence functions of arbitrary order presented.
