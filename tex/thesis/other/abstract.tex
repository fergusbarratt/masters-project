 This project is an investigation of the Jaynes-Cummings system in the presence of coherent drive and dissipation via various mechanisms, with particular focus on the parameter regimes of superconducting circuit QED.
We investigate the system in a variety of parameter regimes, and in the analysis is uncovered bistability in phase and amplitude, non-equilibrium phase transitions and non-classical states of light.
We investigate the conditions under which bimodality develops, and contrast the semiclassical regime, in which quantum fluctuation of the system is neglected, and the fully quantum regime, which we access using numerical simulations.
We also investigate analytical results for the quantum Kerr oscillator of \cite{Drummond1979} and \cite{Kheruntsyan1999}, and investigate the extent to which a perturbative expansion in the excitation number for the Jaynes Cummings oscillator admits these results as descriptions of our system.
