  This project is an investigation of the Jaynes-Cummings system in the presence of coherent drive and dissipation via various mechanisms.
We investigate the system in a variety of parameter regimes, and in the analysis is uncovered bimodalities in phase \& amplitude, clearest in the system quasiprobability representations.
We investigate the conditions under which bimodality develops, and contrast the semiclassical regime, in which quantum fluctuation of the system is neglected, and the fully quantum regime, which we access using numerical simulations.
We also investigate analytical results for the Kerr oscillator \cite{Drummond1979}, and investigate the extent to which a perturbative expansion in the excitation number for the Jaynes Cummings oscillator admits these results as descriptions of our system.
